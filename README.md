# Engineering Productivity Metrics

This repository captures a practical, leadership-oriented approach to measuring and improving
engineering productivity, flow, quality, and security — without weaponizing metrics or slowing teams down.

The focus is on:
- Metrics as decision-support, not performance surveillance
- Engineering enablement over enforcement
- Flow, quality, and security as system outcomes
- Architecting metrics platforms that scale across enterprises

## What this repository is
- A reference model for engineering productivity metrics
- A set of principles, architectures, and playbooks used in large enterprises
- A conversation guide for leaders navigating delivery, risk, and speed

## What this repository is not
- A metrics vanity dashboard
- A ranking system for teams or individuals
- A prescriptive framework detached from context

## Structure
